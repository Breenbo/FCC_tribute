                        On <span class="date">august 2013</span>, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion, which will become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop" target="_blank">Hyperloop</a>.

                            The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming, with the use of the Powerwall, which is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery stationary energy storage products manufactured by Tesla, Inc. The Powerwall is intended to be used for home energy storage and stores electricity for solar self-consumption, time of use load shifting, backup power, and off-the-grid use.

                        In <span class="date">may 2002</span>, with US$100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX" target="_blank">SpaceX</a>.

                        The whole project is clear : no O2, so need to have an electrical civilization iot spread to mars. 
                        Tunnels iot escape the dusts storms.
                        The mars colonization will be underground and electric, or will be not.
